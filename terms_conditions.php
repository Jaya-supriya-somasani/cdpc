                    <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on PTC's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

                            <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by PTC at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>

PTC makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
